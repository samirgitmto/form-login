# Spring Security Login Flow - Log Analysis

This document details the step-by-step login flow in Spring Security based on actual application logs.

## 1. Login Request
```
DEBUG --- [nio-8080-exec-6] o.s.security.web.FilterChainProxy : Securing POST /login
```
- User submits login credentials to `/login` endpoint
- Spring Security's `FilterChainProxy` intercepts the request

## 2. Database Query
```
DEBUG --- [nio-8080-exec-6] org.hibernate.SQL : select u1_0.id, u1_0.enabled, u1_0.password, u1_0.role, u1_0.username from users u1_0 where u1_0.username=?
```
- Spring queries the database to find the user by username
- Hibernate executes the SQL query with parameterized username

## 3. Authentication
```
DEBUG --- [nio-8080-exec-6] o.s.s.a.dao.DaoAuthenticationProvider : Authenticated user
```
- Spring validates the credentials and authenticates the user
- `DaoAuthenticationProvider` confirms successful authentication

## 4. Session Management
```
DEBUG --- [nio-8080-exec-6] .s.ChangeSessionIdAuthenticationStrategy : Changed session id from 685D1F0A15BC113311745E3F379C662C
DEBUG --- [nio-8080-exec-6] o.s.s.w.csrf.CsrfAuthenticationStrategy : Replaced CSRF Token
```
- Creates a new session ID for security (session fixation protection)
- Generates a new CSRF token for form submissions

## 5. Security Context
```
DEBUG --- [nio-8080-exec-6] w.c.HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository : Stored SecurityContextImpl
```
- Stores the authenticated user's details in the security context
- User has role "ROLE_USER"
- Security context is persisted in HTTP session

## 6. Redirect
```
DEBUG --- [nio-8080-exec-6] o.s.s.web.DefaultRedirectStrategy : Redirecting to http://localhost:8080/home?continue
```
- Redirects to the home page after successful login
- Includes 'continue' parameter for request continuation

## 7. Home Page Access
```
DEBUG --- [nio-8080-exec-1] o.s.security.web.FilterChainProxy : Securing GET /home?continue
Home page requested
```
- User is now authenticated and can access the home page
- The security context is maintained for subsequent requests
- Request is processed by the home page controller

## Security Measures in Place

1. **Session Security**
   - Session ID rotation
   - CSRF token protection
   - Secure session management

2. **Authentication**
   - Database-backed authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure credential verification

3. **Request Security**
   - Filter chain protection
   - Request continuation handling
   - Secure redirect strategy

This log analysis demonstrates a complete and secure authentication flow with proper security measures implemented at each step.
