Based on the code I've seen and the project structure, here are several potential security vulnerabilities and attack vectors that could be exploited in this application:
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Vulnerabilities:
While CSRF protection is enabled for most endpoints, it's disabled for the H2 console (csrf.ignoringRequestMatchers(PathRequest.toH2Console())). If the H2 console is exposed, this could be a potential attack vector.
If any custom endpoints are added without proper CSRF protection, they could be vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
Session Management Issues:
The configuration doesn't specify session timeout settings
No session fixation protection is explicitly configured
No concurrent session control is implemented
No secure session cookie settings are defined
Authentication Vulnerabilities:
The login form doesn't implement rate limiting, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks
No account lockout mechanism is visible in the configuration
Password complexity requirements are not enforced (only relying on BCryptPasswordEncoder)
No multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation
Information Disclosure:
The application might be revealing too much information in error messages
Stack traces might be exposed in production
No custom error pages are configured for security-related errors
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):
If the application uses sequential IDs in URLs, it might be vulnerable to IDOR attacks
No proper access control checks on resources
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Vulnerabilities:
No explicit XSS protection headers are configured
No content security policy (CSP) is defined
Input validation and output encoding might not be properly implemented
Insecure File Upload:
If the application allows file uploads, there might be vulnerabilities in file type validation
No file size limits are visible in the configuration
SQL Injection:
While Spring Security provides some protection, if custom SQL queries are used without proper parameterization, they could be vulnerable
H2 console exposure could lead to SQL injection if not properly secured
Missing Security Headers:
No X-Frame-Options header (except for H2 console)
No X-Content-Type-Options header
No Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header
No X-XSS-Protection header
Insecure Configuration:
The application might be running with debug mode enabled in production
Default error pages might expose sensitive information
No proper logging of security events


Recommendations to improve security:
Implement proper session management:
Add security headers:
Implement rate limiting for login attempts:
Add proper CSRF protection:
Implement proper password policies:
Add proper error handling and custom error pages:
Implement proper logging:

Add proper input validation and sanitization:
Use Spring Validation annotations
Implement proper output encoding
Use parameterized queries
Implement proper access control:
Use method-level security annotations
Implement proper role-based access control
Validate user permissions for each request
Regular security updates:
Keep all dependencies updated
Regularly scan for vulnerabilities
Implement proper security monitoring
These vulnerabilities and recommendations should be addressed based on your specific security requirements and threat model. It's recommended to perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix any security issues.
